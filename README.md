# Medical Appointment No Shows Project
This analysis is part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program and aims to explore a dataset containing aproximately 100k medical appointments from the Brazilian public health system. It is basically divided into four sections: (1) Introduction, where the investigation problem is set and the dataset is described; (2) Data Wrangling, where the acquired data are cleaned and parsed; (3) Exploratory Data Analysis, in which some intuition about the data are built based on the found patterns; (4) Conclusion, where the found insights about the problem are reviewed and communicated.focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
